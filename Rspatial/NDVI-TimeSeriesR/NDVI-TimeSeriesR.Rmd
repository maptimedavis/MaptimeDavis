# Introduction

  In order to quantify live vegetation within any area, an indicator, which uses the visible and near-infrared bands of the electromagnetic spectrum called the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),  has been popularized for a wide variety of projects after the invent of remote sensing measurements
  
  Until now, such index has been derived using spatial analysis of GIS packages especially at a specific site and time. Moreover, such has been done manually. In addition, such information gathering over different time scales are not also available yet. In this regard, this workshop presents how NDVI can be derived using open source codes related to R-spatial packages. Further, this exercise demonstrates how such information can automatically be derived and extracts in a time series format. It will also presents an exercise to discretize the raster map under different spatial resolution revealing evolution of NDVI distribution over the given location.
  
  While NDVI information is very useful in various field of studies like agriculture, crop yield, types of vegetation, plant phenology, climate change, seasonal change and beyond, this workshop has been set up with following objectives: 
  
- to learn how to deal with remotely sensed images to extract physical quantities like NDVI
- to visualize rater image and relevant statistics
- to perform sample raster calculation
- to extract NDVI time series from deifferent periods of obesevation
- to visualize spatial dynamics

# Landsat Image

## Why landsat images
  
  Since 1972 the Landsat Mission has been collecting imagery of earth.  This archive of data is free to access and provides researchers with an invaluable resource of continuous coverage for their study areas.  Currently, Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 are in orbit and have a repeat interval of 16 days.  The satellites’ orbits are offset to allow 8-day repeat coverage of any Landsat scene.

## Downloading Landsat images

- Go to www.earthexplorer.usgs.gov
-  If you do not have earth explorar account, register for an account, certain features are accessible without an account, but to download data an account is necessary.
- Enter search criteria to define your area  and dates of interest; if using a shapefile, the data must be uploaded as a *.zip
- Under datasets you can choose which imagery archives to search through; note that earth explorer hosts more than just Landsat data.
- Under the Landsat collection, you can choose which Landsat satellites you want to add to your search and which level of data processing you want for the imagery products.  For this tutorial we used Collection 1 Level-2, Landsat 8 data.  Level 2 imagery is processed to surface reflectance.
- Under additional criteria you can further refine your search parameters.  One example is to set limits on the amount of cloud cover you want to allow in any scene
- Run the search by hitting the results button.  This returns a set of images that meet your criteria.  For each image you can view its metadata and display the footprint of the image tile over your area of interest.
- Depending on which type of imagery you want to access, the download options will change.  Landsat Collection-1 Level 2 data is generated on demand and must submitted as an order to USGS.  You will receive an email when your imagery request has been fulfilled and is ready to download.  If you are using the Landsat ARD (analysis ready data) Collection, this imagery is immediately available for download and can be downloaded individually or with the bulk download option.
- Once you know which Landsat scenes you want to download there are other options you can explore to speed up the process.  See: github.com/USGS-EROS/espa-bulk-downloader

## Download Landsat Images
  For this workshop, we have already downloaded Landsat image and stored in `google drive`. Before the workshop make sure that all the files are under `Data` folder and also note that all the image files named with "YYYYMMDD.tif" format

# Method
  Here, we mostly use R-studio interface except for downloading landsat imagary files. Our purpose is to use simple and widly used open source library as much as possible. This workshop, entirely, will be done using R-Markdown because R Markdown documents are fully reproducible. Moreover, it allows you to see narrative text and code and preview on table and figures in an elegantly formatted version. It also allows us to save in `html` or `pdf` format. To learn more about `R Markdown`, refer to https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/
  
  Our area of interest covers part of the San Joaquin Experimental Range which is located in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada in Coarsegold, Madera County, about 20 miles north of Fresno.  San Joaquin contains open woodland dominated by oaks (blue and interior live oaks) and digger pine with scattered shrubs and nearly continuous cover of herbaceous plants.

## Custumized functions
Here are some functions for this workshop and later you can use freely. These functions are developed by us to make ease of analysis. In the second part of workshop, we will use these function intensively.
```{r, echo = TRUE}
NDVI <- function(X, Y){
  # generates raster of given two bands
  #X: Near infrared band Image
  #Y: Red band Image
  ndvi <- (X-Y)/(X+Y)
  return(ndvi)
}

  imgRaster.df <- as.data.frame(imgRaster, xy = TRUE)
  colnames(imgRaster.df)<-c('x', 'y', valueStr)
  pltHist<-ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(data = imgRaster.df, aes_string(x=valueStr), fill='green')+
    xlab(valueStr) + ylab('Frequency')+
    scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(0.3,0.7))+
    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0))+
    theme_bw()
  return(pltHist)
}

getcropArea<-function(X1,X2, Y1, Y2){
  # generates a set of coordinates for ractangles to be plotted based on
  # X1, Y1: lower bound
  # X2, Y2: upper bound
  rectangle.df = data.frame(matrix(NaN, nrow = 5, ncol = 2))
  colnames(rectangle.df) = c('x', 'y')
  rectangle.df$x[c(1,4,5)] = X1
  rectangle.df$x[c(2,3)] = X2
  rectangle.df$y[c(1,2,5)] = Y1
  rectangle.df$y[c(3,4)] = Y2
  return(rectangle.df)
}

meanNDVI<- function(rasterNDVI){
  # calculates average NDVI over given raster
  dataMatrix <- rasterToPoints(rasterNDVI)
  return(mean(dataMatrix[,3], na.rm = TRUE))
}
```



# Tutoral 1: A single multiband raster image
The first part of our workshop will focus on a single  image with following tasks:

- how to read the multiband raster data; 
- to extract individual band raster
- to perform raster calulation 
- to visualize its statistics

In this first part, we will go through mannual steps for calculation and visualization. In next part we will use customized functions.

## Loading and visualizing
A function `stack()` embedded in `raster` package creates a `RasterStack`, a collection of RasterLayer objects. Here we use this function to read multiband raster image and then view the data structure. For this, we use one of the stored file `20180202.tif` under `Data` folder.
```{r, echo = TRUE}
imageFileName = 'Data/20180202.tif'
raster1 <- stack(imageFileName)
raster1
```
Since there are multiple bands of, we can check the number or layer using `nlayers()` function
```{r, echo = TRUE}
nlayers(raster1)
```
see there are four bands each of which are:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
raster1@layers
```

In both cases, we saw three layers corersponding to blue, green, red and near infrared. In order to calculate NDVI, we need two bands, namley red (third layer) and near infrared (fourth layer). So we simple assign third element of `raster1` as `redBand` and fourth one as `NIRBand`

## Getting stacked rasters
```{r, echo = TRUE}
redBand<- raster1[[3]]
redBand
NIRBand<- raster1[[4]]
NIRBand
```

## Visualizing  rasters 
We can plot rastar images individually just using `ggplot` embedded in `ggplot2` package. For this, one needs to convert rater data to a dataframe. We may use `as.data.frame` funcion to do this as the `raster` package has an built-in function for conversion to a plotable dataframe. So, let's view both raster data. Here we rename layer to `value` for simplicity while we reneame the column names of this data frame. In this excersise, we just set the default values of color scale to `scale_fill_viridis_c()` and also to the `coord_quickmap()` function to use an approximate Mercator projection for our plots.
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.width= 8, fig.height =8}
redBand.df <- as.data.frame(redBand, xy = TRUE)
colnames(redBand.df)<-c('x', 'y', 'value')
plt.red<-ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = redBand.df , aes(x = x, y = y, fill = value)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = 'plasma') +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0))+
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0))+
  xlab('') + ylab('')+
  ggtitle('Red band image')+
  coord_quickmap()+
  theme_bw()
plt.red
```
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.width= 8, fig.height =8}
NIRBand.df <- as.data.frame(NIRBand, xy = TRUE)
colnames(NIRBand.df)<-c('x', 'y', 'value')
plt.nir<-ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = NIRBand.df , aes(x = x, y = y, fill = value)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = 'inferno') +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0))+
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0))+
  xlab('') + ylab('')+
  coord_quickmap()+
  ggtitle('Near Infrared band image')+
theme_bw()
plt.nir
```

## NDVI Calculation example
Now, we have two raster data ready to calculate NDVI using simple equation, 

  $NDVI= \frac{R_{4} - R_{3}}{R_{4} + R_{3}}$
                
Where $R_{3}$ refers to raster in red region and $R_{4}$ to raster in NIR region. We simply use this equation to perform rater calculation as:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
ndvi <- (NIRBand - redBand)/(NIRBand + redBand)
print(ndvi)
```

Here `ndvi` is new raster data contatining information about NDVI over the entire locatoion. Since we already went through how to plot raster image, here we use customised function `ggrasterPlot()` fubction to plot `ndvi` raster data. This function requires raster information, name of attributes, title and color scheme.
```{r, echo = TRUE, warning= FALSE}
plt.NDVI<-ggrasterPlot(ndvi, 'NDVI', 'Entire Area',colorScheme =  'viridis')
plt.NDVI
```
Once again, we use `ggplot()` function to draw histogram of NDVI over the entire area. To to this, we use `geom_histogram()`  after converting into a data frame named `ndvi.df` with one of colum name given to `NDVI`.
```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
  ndvi.df <- as.data.frame(ndvi, xy = TRUE)
  colnames(ndvi.df)<-c('x', 'y', 'NDVI')
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = ndvi.df, aes(NDVI), fill='green')+
  xlab('NDVI') + ylab('Frequency')+
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0))+
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0))+
  theme_bw()
```
While this plot gives NDVI informaton over the space, we usually report average value of such quantity. So, to calculate the average NDVI for whole raster, we convert NDVI raster to data matrix, named `dataMatrix` using a `rasterToPoints()`  funtion built in `raster package
```{r, echo = TRUE}
dataMatrix <- rasterToPoints(ndvi)
```
`dataMatrix` is a data frame now. Now, we would like to see the structure of this data matrixusing `str()` and `head()` functions. 
```{r, echo = TRUE}
str(dataMatrix)
head(dataMatrix)
```

Since columns named `x` and `y`  correspond to geo-coordinates, third column is obvisouly NDVI. In order to find the average value of NDVI, third column is used in `mean()` function
```{r, echo = TRUE}
NDVI.avg <- mean(dataMatrix[,3])
print(NDVI.avg)
```

# Tutorial 2: Temporal Analysis
## Loading series of rasters and calculating NDVI
As mentioned before, over a year there must be at least 24 files, each for a month. To avoid combersome task, `list.files()` is used to list the files. Here we just select the raster image file with `.tif` extension, so an argument `pattern` is used as  
```{r, echo = TRUE}
fileList = list.files("Data/", pattern = "*.tif$")
fileList
```
See there are 14 files with the format of `YYYYmmdd.tif`. Now, we convert each string into date string. To do this, first, use `substr()` function starting from first character to eighth character as 
```{r, echo = TRUE}
datestr = substr(fileList, start =  1, stop =  8)
```
Then, let's split date string above into three parts (a) year, (b) month and (c) date using same `substr()` function
```{r, echo = TRUE}
yearstr = substr(datestr, start =  1, stop =  4)
monthstr = substr(datestr, start =  5, stop =  6)
daystr = substr(datestr,  start =  7, stop =  8)
```
Now, concatenate above three strings into a formated date string with `YYYY-mm-dd` style using `paste()` function and then convert them into a class of date using `as.Date()` function assign a set of dates as `dateVec`.
```{r, echo = TRUE}
dateChar = paste(yearstr, monthstr, daystr, sep='-')
dateVec = as.Date(dateChar)
```
Finally, let's load all the file automatically using `for` loop. Inside loop, perform following tasks:

- assign each file as `imageFileNameI`
- read multiband image, using `stack()` function as explained before
- extract red and NIR band rasters
- calculate NDVI as `NDVI.Indv` from these two bands using prededined function `NDVI()` 
- convert  raster `NDVI.Indv` into a matrix of points using `rasterToPoints()` and
- for simplicity, compute individual NDVI using `mean()` function

Store NDVI values int a data frame `NDVI.ts` which contains only`DATE` column.
```{r, echo = TRUE}
nFiles = length(fileList)
NDVI.ts <- data.frame(DATE = dateVec)
for (i in 1:nFiles) {
  imageFileNameI <- paste('Data/', fileList[i], sep = '')
  rasterImg <- stack(imageFileNameI)
  redBand.Indv<- rasterImg[[3]]
  NIRBand.Indv<- rasterImg[[4]]
  NDVI.Indv <- NDVI(NIRBand.Indv, redBand.Indv)
  dataMatrix <- rasterToPoints(NDVI.Indv)
  NDVI.ts$NDVI[i] <- mean(dataMatrix[,3])
}
```
Thus, NDVI time series is ready to store for future use. To do this, export NDVI time series, just obtained into a file named `testNDVI.csv` using a `write.csv()` function as:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
write.csv(NDVI.ts, file = 'testNDVI.csv', row.names = F)
```

## Loading NDVI time series
Let's load previously saved `csv` file for analysis. Please note that you can use the previously defined dataframe `NDVI.ts`. But for illustration purpose, here, use `read.csv` function setting `stringsAsFactors` as `FALSE` to import NDVI time series from the file `testNDVI.csv`.  Then use `head()` function to see first five rows of the data.
```{r, echo = TRUE}
readTs <- read.csv('testNDVI.csv',stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE)
head(readTs)
```

## Visualizing temporal dynamics
As a part of studying dyanamics, simple task to visualize the evolution of NDVI. So, here we plot imported NDVI time series using `ggplot()` function embbeded in `ggplot2` package. Below is the simple version of the plot:
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.width= 8, fig.height =3}
readTs$DATE = as.Date(readTs$DATE)
plt.Ts<-ggplot(data = readTs)+
  geom_line(aes(x=DATE, y = NDVI), color ='blue')+
  xlab('Date') + ylab('NDVI')+
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(0.3, 0.6))+
  scale_x_date(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(dateVec[1], dateVec[length(dateVec)]), labels = date_format("%m-%d-%Y"))+
  ggtitle('Evolution of NDVI for the year 2018')+
  theme_bw()
plt.Ts
```

# Tutorial 3: Spatial Analysis
Here we look variability of NDVI over the space. For this purpose, we descritize one image recorded very first into four equal pieces. For simplicity, we will use rectangular block.

## Information about location
First, we define the corner of each block. To do this, let's find the extent of whole image using `min()` and `max()` functions after converting original NDVI raster `ndvi` into a data matrix followed by seperate two vectors of `X-` and `Y-` cooredinates 
```{r, echo = TRUE}
dataMatrix <- rasterToPoints(ndvi)
xcoord = dataMatrix[,1]
ycoord = dataMatrix[,2]
maxX <- max(dataMatrix[,1])
maxY <- max(dataMatrix[,2])
minX <- min(dataMatrix[,1])
minY <- min(dataMatrix[,2])
```
Here are the extent of raster
```{r, echo = TRUE}
c(minX, maxX, minY, maxY)
```
## Croping extent
Now, we crop raster into four equal pieces by defining their extents from the middle half and center half as
```{r, echo = TRUE}
midX = (minX+maxX)/2 # center half
midY = (minY+maxY)/2 # middle half
```
Below are the four croping area defined via customized function `getcropArea()`. This function requires four attributes: each two belongs to orthogonal axis and returns a set of coordinate for a rectangle. Note that these crop area will be used for plotting purpose but not for croping purpose.
```{r, echo = TRUE}
cropArea1 <- getcropArea(minX, midX,minY, midY)
cropArea2 <- getcropArea(midX, maxX,minY, midY)
cropArea3 <- getcropArea(minX, midX,midY, maxY)
cropArea4 <- getcropArea(midX, maxX,midY, maxY)
```
Using these `cropArea`s, superimpose crop area boundary over the image to see the descretization scheme by plotting raster and rectanguler blocks. Here we use `geom_rect` to distinguish crop areas.
```{r, echo = TRUE}
ndvi.df <- as.data.frame(ndvi, xy = TRUE)
colnames(ndvi.df)<-c('x', 'y', 'ndvi')
plt.NDVI<-ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = ndvi.df , aes(x = x, y = y, fill = ndvi)) +
  geom_rect(data=cropArea1, mapping=aes(xmin=minX, xmax=midX, 
                                           ymin=minY, ymax=midY),
            color="black", alpha=0, size = 1.5) +
  geom_rect(data=cropArea2, mapping=aes(xmin=midX, xmax=maxX, 
                                           ymin=minY, ymax=midY),
            color="black", alpha=0, size = 1.5) +
  geom_rect(data=cropArea3, mapping=aes(xmin=minX, xmax=midX, 
                                           ymin=midY, ymax=maxY),
            color="black", alpha=0, size = 1.5) +
  geom_rect(data=cropArea4, mapping=aes(xmin=midX, xmax=maxX, 
                                           ymin=midY, ymax=maxY),
            color="black", alpha=0, size = 1.5) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = 'viridis') +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0))+
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0))+
  xlab('') + ylab('')+
  coord_quickmap()+
  ggtitle('NDVI for whole image')+
theme_bw()
plt.NDVI

```
Use `extent` function to define extent of raster image from just defined four corners. For more information, please refer to `Extent` function in R documentation [https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/raster/versions/2.6-7/topics/extent]
```{r, echo = TRUE}
crop_extent1 = extent(minX, midX, minY, midY)
crop_extent2 <- extent(midX, maxX,minY, midY)
crop_extent3 <- extent(minX, midX,midY, maxY)
crop_extent4 <- extent(midX, maxX,midY, maxY)
```
Now, let's crop rasters using `crop()` function with arguments of raster and extent. To learn more about this function, please refer to https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/raster/versions/2.8-19/topics/crop.
Also, here we use our costumized function `meanNDVI` to calculate NDVI of each block as:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
imgCrop1 <- crop(ndvi, crop_extent1)
meanNDVI1 = meanNDVI(imgCrop1)
print(meanNDVI1)
imgCrop2 <- crop(ndvi, crop_extent2)
meanNDVI2 = meanNDVI(imgCrop2)
print(meanNDVI2)
imgCrop3 <- crop(ndvi, crop_extent3)
meanNDVI3 = meanNDVI(imgCrop3)
print(meanNDVI3)
imgCrop4 <- crop(ndvi, crop_extent4)
meanNDVI4 = meanNDVI(imgCrop4)
print(meanNDVI4)
```
These are NDVI values foe each blocks in order

## Visualizing spatial dynamics
Once again, recalling original NDVI raster`ndvi`, we can again plot the histogram for entire area. But here we use costomized function `ggrasterHist()` to have few lines of codes.
```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Entire
pltall<-ggrasterHist(ndvi, 'NDVI')
pltall+ggtitle('Entire Area')
```

This is the histogram of NDVI distribution over the entire area. Now we will look into seperate distribution of such quantities using `ggrasterHist()` function.
```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
# bottom left
plt.corner1<-ggrasterHist(imgCrop1, 'NDVI')
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
#  bottom right
plt.corner2<-ggrasterHist(imgCrop2, 'NDVI')
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
# top left
plt.corner4<-ggrasterHist(imgCrop3, 'NDVI')
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
#  top right
plt.corner3<-ggrasterHist(imgCrop4, 'NDVI')
```

In this way, we have four histograms and let's combine them using `ggarrange()` function embedded in `ggpubr` package and customize as needed. 
```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggarrange(plt.corner3+ggtitle('Top Left')+geom_vline(xintercept = meanNDVI3),
          plt.corner4+ggtitle('Top Right')+geom_vline(xintercept = meanNDVI4),
          plt.corner1+ggtitle('Bottom Left')+geom_vline(xintercept = meanNDVI1),
          plt.corner2+ggtitle('Bottom Right')+geom_vline(xintercept = meanNDVI2),
          nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
```

See how distribution varies from one corner to another corner. 
```{r}
print('------------------- END OF THE WORKSHOP --------------------')
```
